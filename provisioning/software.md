## Operating Systems and Software
The Apprenda Platform makes use of the Microsoft family of technologies for core Platform functionality, as well as specified flavors of Linux for optional Java support. Optional Oracle RDBMS installations are OS agnostic. Fundamentally, its goal is to perform ordinary application deployment tasks more quickly and more efficiently than ever before possible.  The Platform works well within the following software specifications, classified by role.  In most cases, the required software configuration can be achieved on Windows Servers by using the Server Administration tools and applying server Roles and specific Features.  

The Apprenda Platform Installer will validate your configuration prior to installation. In some cases, software customizations and/or unique configurations will require changes to the Apprenda Platform that the Installer cannot accommodate.  If you think you have the need for a specialized install, contact support@apprenda.com.  In order to avoid incompatibilities, no additional software should be installed on your Platform servers unless approved by Apprenda.
